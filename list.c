 * (which will be passed to list_remove() when it's called, so you don't have
 * to worry about writing it yourself) should be passed two void* values,
 * `val` and a value stored in the list against which to compare `val`.  If
 * the two values should be considered as equal, then the function will return
 * 0, and if the two values should be considered as not equal, then the
